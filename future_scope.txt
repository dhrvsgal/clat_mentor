This recommendation system uses static feature matching and cosine similarity. However, it can evolve into a more dynamic, feedback-driven recommendation engine over time. Here's how:

 âœ… 1. Feedback Collection
After each mentorship session or recommendation, aspirants can rate their mentors on:

Effectiveness of teaching

Subject alignment

Teaching style satisfaction

Overall experience

 ðŸ”„ 2. Model Fine-tuning
Using this feedback, the system can:

Re-weight feature importance dynamically (e.g., if teaching style is consistently more influential than rank).

Learn individual preferences using techniques like collaborative filtering or reinforcement learning.

Adapt mentor profiles based on updated success rates or session outcomes.

 ðŸ§  3. User Profiling and Personalization
Build deeper user profiles over time.

Track learning patterns, session duration, and progress to recommend mentors more precisely.

Gradually shift from cosine similarity to more advanced models like neural collaborative filtering or decision trees for better personalization.

 ðŸ“Š 4. Data-Driven Mentor Evaluation
Aggregate feedback to update mentor rankings and success metrics.

Promote high-performing mentors automatically and identify those needing support or retraining.
